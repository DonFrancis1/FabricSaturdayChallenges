# Project Details

## 💡 Optimizing Performance and Size of a Power BI Model

### 🎯 Objective

Improve the data model size and query performance of the Power BI Model using best practices.

### 🗂️ Scenario
Van Arsdel has been experiencing severe performance issues with their quarterly executive dashboard. The COO escalated concerns after the board meeting dashboard took an average 10 - 15 seconds to load on every interaction, creating a bad experience for stakeholders.

## Current Issues:

Dashboard load time: 10 - 15 Seconds
Model size: 192 MB 
Visuals timing out sometimes

## Business Impact:

Executive productivity loss of 2-3 hours weekly
Decision-making delays affecting quarterly planning
Board presentation failures damaging stakeholder confidence


### ✅ Goal
1.	Reduce Data Model Size to less than 40 MB following Data model best practices

2.	Optimize DAX Measures in underlisted visuals to render in less than 2 seconds while protecting data integrity
